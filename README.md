A web application built with TensorFlow.js that allows users to draw handwritten digits on a canvas and predicts the digit using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The app leverages the MNIST dataset to train the model and provides real-time digit recognition, making it a fun and interactive tool to explore machine learning concepts.
